## About
* Friend Finder is a full-stack web application that utilizes Express.js to quickly and simply create it's server. Fundamentally, the app operates like a simple dating app, allowing users to create a very minimal profile (name and photo) and answer a series of questions/prompts. When submitted, a POST operation takes their scores to the api/friends path and compares them to previous user's scores. The previous user whose answers most closely resemble the current user's scores is then chosen as a their "Best Match," and their name and image is shown to the current user.

(Currently, input validation is not in place for the form submission. The app is in its most minimally viable state.)

## How-to use this code
